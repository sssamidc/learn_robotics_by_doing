# Learn Robotics by Doing

A hands-on journey into robotics using a **Raspberry Pi 4**, a **Camera**, and a mix of **Python, C++, and Rust**.

## Philosophy
*   **Hands-on**: Code first, theory second.
*   **Polyglot**: Compare how different languages handle system constraints.
*   **Incremental**: Build complex systems from simple building blocks.

## Getting Started
1.  Read the [Curriculum](./docs/Curriculum.md) to see the roadmap.
2.  Jump into the `exercises/` directory!

## Current Status
*   [x] Module 1: Foundation (In Progress)
